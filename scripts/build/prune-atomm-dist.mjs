/**
 * Remove the public site's static files from an Atomm build.
 *
 * The Atomm package is the studio alone (svelte.config.js prerenders only its
 * pages), but SvelteKit still copies every file in `static/`. The marketing and
 * guide images and the example project files (SITE_ONLY_PATHS) are only
 * reached from site pages, so they are dropped here. Everything the studio
 * fetches at runtime stays: `data/` (place search's lake directory), icons,
 * and licence texts.
 * Outside the Atomm build this does nothing.
